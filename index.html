        <p>
        Originally from Iowa, Brett moved with his family to Georgia in 1989. That was the same year that Georgia had a record snowfall in December, which Brett often says was “Georgia’s way of welcoming him.” 
        </p>

        <p>
        He graduated from Effingham County High School, completed courses in Illustration and Sequential Art at SVA in New York, and completed Governor’s Honors Program at Valdosta State University for Fine Arts. He was awarded the distinction of “Best Cartoonist, Weekly” by the Georgia Press Association in 2003. During his time in the marketing department of the Savannah Morning News, he was awarded “Best Promotion in Print” and “Best Promotion Out of Print” and “Best Advertising Campaign” by the Georgia Press Association every single year that he entered the competition. Brett has received three commendations from Senator Jack Hill’s office for his excellent work in media.
